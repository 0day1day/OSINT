    "summary": "Not much to say about it but Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic daykills, Knuckles is a bodyguard, Tails is an inspector and Amy distracts. Oh, and Shadow is a non-revealing daykiller too. This is by MrGameAndWatch and  Game And Watch. Thanks to Jacze and Drapht for helping me with the finsihing touches. Bunches of thanks to Bebbz for uploading this for me. Also thanks to Dont Shoot Me for helping me find bugs in this theme. So now to the updates: I added Chaotix with Charmy, Vector, and Espio. Vector kills, Charmy distracts and Espio... you'll find that out. Also less humans and more Eggman goons. I also added Super Sonic who is sided by himslef. He daykills and poisons. Plus more Eggman robos, Mighty the Armadillo and Big the Cat. The Eggman Robos are sided by themselves now. Also Super Sonic daykill may reveal. (Trying to make the villans less OP) Big thanks to Mr.Anonymous for just helping with ideas and crap.",
