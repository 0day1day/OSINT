12/17/11 19:31:33 * Puscifer, having grown tired of the nothingness that was happening in the bar, made her way to one of the private rooms for a bit of a rest. Not like she was tired or anything, just lazy, and was content to be by herself, thinking, hoping, fantasizing.. ahh. She bounced as she walked down the hall, finally finding a room in which to settle down. Small, but neat, with a large (and hopefully clean bed), a dresser, a few chairs here and there. She made her way towards the bed and wiggled, pushing herself up onto her tippy-toes before scooting back onto it, then lying down while simultaneously releasing a long sigh. Her eyes closed for a moment, and she rested.
12/17/11 19:32:44 Puscifer: [btw, we don't have to do long long posts! Anything is really fine with me, as long as it gets the point across. :)]
12/17/11 19:33:20 Kari#SO: [I do a mixture ^^]
12/17/11 19:33:46 Puscifer: [Perfect. :)]
12/17/11 19:35:00 Kari#SO: [<3]
12/18/11 21:14:18 Kari#SO: :hurried along the hallways of the bar's upper floor, her shift would have been that of a dead one, most likely because of the current weather outside. Letting out a soft yawn, she would walk along, and come to one of the doors, it was half open, but dark inside. Slowly pushing the door open, figuring the room was empty. HUrrying inside, she would turn her back to whom was in the room, closing the door behind her and turning back to face the room. She would not spot the other as of yet, as she moved slowly over to one of the couchs, and sprawled out her Human appearing form with a settle yawn, taking care to adjust her mini skirt, which had ridden up some, and the front of the black tank top she had worn.

12/18/11 21:15:12 Puscifer: [Sorry about last night! I had to get into bed, I wasn't sure how long it was going to take you to post. I can reply back now though, if you're still interested in continuing the RP. :)]
12/18/11 21:22:35 Kari#SO: [of course I am ^^]
12/18/11 21:28:21 * Puscifer roused slightly at the sound of the door opening and closing. One eye opened and rolled around, and her lip would curl up, displaying her fangs even more, as her near invisible nose took in the new smell that entered the room. She growled softly, and tightened her grip on her whip as she sat up. The room was dimly lit, but this proved no problem to her demonic eyes as she squinted and quickly gained focus. There, lounging on the couch in what she had now claimed as her room, was another being. Her lips curled up in a snarl, fangs now fully bared, as she hopped off of the bed, growing taller by a few feet as she charged across the room. Whip held firmly in hand, she stopped just inches from the human being, bosoms bouncing a full few moments after she'd suddenly stopped, and she roared, "What are you doing in <I>my</i> room?"
12/18/11 21:33:45 * Kari#SO eyes of honey had finally shut as a relaxed state had over come her body. she would flicker her ears back, but before all that slumber could come, she was startled awake by the roaring of the femme, eyes widened now as she pulled herself to surl up at the end of the couch, against one of the arms furthest from where the femme had stood. Gulping gently Kari would watch, at a loss for words, as her wolven ear spinned to her skull, and her fingers gripped at the arm of the couch, she would just blink with wide eyes for now, shocked.
12/18/11 21:40:03 * Puscifer's eyes remained squinted, focus fully on the human, fangs glinting even in the dull light of the room. She gripped the hilt of her whip even tighter, the leather squeaking against the smooth scales of her hand. "I asked, what are you doing in my room?" Her chest was puffed out, which made her look rather silly for her ... rather womanly shape.
12/18/11 21:42:29 * Kari#SO let out a gulp, as she shifted against where she sat, her lower lip jutted out, wolven ears pinned back, and honey coloured eyes wide, and alittle full of nerve. She would slowly sit up, whispering softly. "i..i'm sorry Ma'am.. I beleived this room to be.. v..vacant." she would studder out softly, in a soft whimper, glancing away as she slowly stood. "i'll just..be.. go..going." she'd studder once more as she raised, and slowly walked towards the door.
12/18/11 21:47:32 * Puscifer leaned into the human as she sat up, getting right up into her face. "Well, as you can see it is <I>not. vacant.</i>" She noticed the glance towards the door, and looked that way as well, but large demon eyes quickly shifted to look back to the human just as she was rising out of her seat and towards the door. Her arm shot out, making her entirety jiggle a bit, and that whip was straight in front of where the human was walking, essentially blocking the way. "No, I don't think you'll be going anywhere."
12/18/11 21:51:52 * Kari#SO eyes would grow wide as she stepped back, her ears pinned as she glanced around with a frown. "im terribly sorry Ma'am.. I really am.." she'd bite her lower lip softly, but judging by how she held her whip, in a blocking kind of way, Kari had to just slowly step back and sit back down on the couch, her head bowed downwards nervously. 
12/18/11 21:59:25 * Puscifer smirked, near-invisible nostrils flaring once more as she smelled the delicious scent of fear coming from the human. She purred and smiled as the human sat down, and moved the whip to place the stiff end on the top of the human's head, keeping her head lowered. "You think you're sorry now, just wait.." She raised her own head to look down upon her. "Do you have a name, human?"
12/18/11 22:01:00 * Kari#SO bit down into her lower lip softly, as she shifted alittle more nervously. Kari had no idea what this femme had on her mind, her ears remianin pinned to her skull, as she gulped very lightly. "yes..Ma'am... m..my name is Kari [Car-ree]" she would flicker an aud slowly.
12/18/11 22:05:45 * Puscifer slowly moved the whip down, letting the tail end of it run over the top of the human's head before letting it fall to the ground, where she grabbed it and looped it a few times to hold on to it. She tilted her head, grinning at the audible gulp. "Kari, hmm? No, I don't very much like that at all." A free hand reached out and she grabbed a hand full of the human's hair, forcing her to look up. "I think I'll call you slave." She laughed, a deep, evil belly laugh, sure to send shivers up one's spine, and violently shoved the human's head down. She let loose the whip and cracked it out to the side. "Get off the couch. Get undressed. Then get on the floor, on your knees, keep your head down."
12/18/11 22:16:27 Kari#SO: [SORRY POSTS WILL BE A BIT DELAYED <3 oops caps]
12/18/11 22:44:15 Puscifer: [Okay.]
12/18/11 22:56:05 Kari#SO: [sorry I was playing League of Legends ^^]
12/18/11 22:56:15 Puscifer: [Oh lol that's ok]
12/18/11 23:04:44 Kari#SO: [posting now =3]
12/18/11 23:04:50 Puscifer: [Yay. <3]
12/18/11 23:15:38 * Kari#SO eyes were wide as she would watch her intently. She would gulp a few more times, rather nervous for the moment, having no idea as to what this femme had intended.She would eye her curiously upon hearing that her name was not liked, not at all. Ears shot back as she grabbed at her hair, eyes were wide as she gulped to her words with a frown. ""sl..slave?" she'd flicker her ears back softly as she heard her words, this causing her to shudder with fear, as she slowly raised to stand, and strippedoff her clothing for the femme, standing there nude before her with a flicker of her wolven tail. Kari would fall to her hands and knees, lowering her head downwards with a whimper.
12/18/11 23:21:16 * Puscifer cracked the whip once again, this time not out to the side but nearer the the now bare human. She didn't hit her though -- not yet. "Did you not hear me the first time? Do you have problems hearing, <I><B>slave</B></I>?" The word was hissed, spat, emphasized.She walked a slow circle around the girl, laying the loose tail of the whip over her back and moving it back and forth over her flesh, teasing. Bending down, she took the girl's tail into her hand, and lifted it up, as if she were inspecting the merchandise. Pleased, she released the tail and walked to be in front of the girl. "Ok, now. On your knees. I want you to walk on your knees," she pointed with the whip over to the bed, "to the bed."
12/18/11 23:31:54 * Kari#SO resting upon her knees now, she would glance up with only her eyes, not daring to lift her head from bowing down. She would gulp gently as her wolven ears remianed pinned to her skull, those rainbow bangs resting against her cheeks, dangling as her head hung. She would remain upon her lnees as she began to crawl forward, heading towards the bed, her head remianing bowed forward and tail dropped against her legs, her wolven decent would reveal the submissive ways of her movements. 
12/18/11 23:35:46 * Puscifer continued to look down upon the girl, grinning and obviously pleased. The grin though quickly turned to another fang-baring snarl, as the girl was not moving fast enough for her. She took the hilt of the whip and gave a quick swat on the girl's rear, not enough to bruise but certainly enough to hurt. "Move it, slave! Hurry to the edge of that bed!" She stomped, her eyes now glowing red, and gave the girl's read another swat.
12/19/11 00:04:48 Kari#SO: She would gasp as she felt the whip to her rear,crawling quicker the best she could in this form. She'd move near to the edge of the bed, her head remianing bowed forward, as she wondered what it was this femme wanted with her. Kari would gulp softly, as desperate whimeprs would press from he rhuman lips, fingers gripping at the floro of the room, while eyes were closed.
