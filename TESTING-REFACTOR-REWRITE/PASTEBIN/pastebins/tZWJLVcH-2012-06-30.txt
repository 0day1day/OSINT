Dear AT ower,

a while ago I donated 60â‚¬ vor an VIP ACC.

As i loged in, first everything was fine.

But then I saw that I wasnt able to buy ALL Mounts and ALL 264 Items like ICC Shoulders etc.

So its not like u said, full geared at all!!!

So for this Reason I want my Money back, please.

If this leads that my Account gets perm banned & IP banned, its fine I can live with that, but not with the Fact that I payed for something that I didnt get!

If u wont contact me with in the few 45 Days, I will have to contact my awyer.

Hope to hear from you, dont take it personal.

Regards,

Felix S.
